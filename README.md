The research resolves around the [Facebook post](https://www.facebook.com/zuck/posts/10102586760792431) of Mark Zuckerberg, which shows a picture of his daughter guided by the text that it is time for her vaccines. The conducted research first gives an overview of the mostly used arguments pro and contra. Second it is focussed on the sentiments individuals express on the relation between vaccination and autism.
